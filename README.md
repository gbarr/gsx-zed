[GSX](https://gsxhq.github.io/) syntax highlighting support for [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed).

- Tree-sitter: [gsxhq/tree-sitter-gsx](https://github.com/gsxhq/tree-sitter-gsx)

## Developing
1. Clone repository
2. Open Zed editor
3. Open Command Palette (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on MacOS, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on Linux)
4. Type "zed: install dev extension" and press <kbd>enter</kbd>
5. Select this repository directory, then start testing

### Tips
- To rebuild the extension, press "Rebuild" on the page from "zed: extensions" (Command Palette).
- To see the generated Tree-Sitter Query AST, open "dev: open syntax tree view" (Command Palette).

> [!NOTE]
> If you rebuilt and uninstalled the extension, then tried to reinstall it, you may see an error.
> This can happen if a generated `grammars` directory already exists; delete it and try again.
